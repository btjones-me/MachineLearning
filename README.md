# MachineLearning

btjones-me: This is another one of those I fully intend to get around to learning and I hope that in forking it I will be slightly more likely to get around to it..

This is where I learn machine learningü§∑‚Äç This means that this repo covers no specific topic of machine learning or a project - I work in here when I want to learn/try something

I'll try to keep it orgamised but I don't want it to be too nested because that becomes a pain to navigate, instead I'll try to keet the table of content up-to-date.

fyi if I use a jupyter notebook I'm experimenting with something and the code will probably be a mess ... so don't take those too serious.

## Table of Content
* [Transfer Learning for Computer vision](https://github.com/wilhelmberghammer/MachineLearning/tree/main/transfer_learning_cv)

### Paper/Architecture implementations
* [DCGAN paper implementation in PyTorch](https://github.com/wilhelmberghammer/MachineLearning/tree/main/DCGAN_pytorch)
* [Neural Style Transfer - implementation in PyTorch](https://github.com/wilhelmberghammer/MachineLearning/tree/main/neural_style_transfer)


### Working on
* [Object detection](https://github.com/wilhelmberghammer/MachineLearning/tree/main/object_detection)


### Coming up
* [Weights & Biases](https://wandb.ai/site)
